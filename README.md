# SMART-BUDGET-AND-FINANCE-MANAGER-
I WANT TO ADD A THRESHOLD LIMIT TO EACH CATEGORY  IN THIS CODE. LIKE FOR FOOD IT IS LET'S SAY 2500. FOR BIKE : 1000 FOR GROCERIES : 3500  AND SO ON.   IF MONEY IS SPENT FOR FOOD BEYOND 2500, IT WILL BE COUNTED AS ' EXCESS MONEY SPENT',  EXAMPLE) IF MY SPENDING ON FOOD IS 3000, THE EXCESS MONEY SPENT ON FOOD WILL BE 3000-2500 = 500   IF MY SPENDING ON BIKE IS 3000, IT WILL DISPLAY : EXCESS MONEY SPENT = 3000-100 = 2000  SIMILARLY FOR OTHER CATEGORIES.   AT THE END , THE EXCESS MONEY SPENT ON EACH CATEGORY WILL BE ADDED AND THE USER WILL BE NOTIFIES ABOUT HIS EXCESSIVE SPENDINGS    HERE IS THE CODE.
